H-Bridge DC-DC Converter (In progress)
========================
This repository is a project about **SMPS H-Bridge DC-DC converter**, it is going to step down from high voltage 360V to low voltage 50V for driving load. The circuit will be constructed on a prototype board and later on will be move on to PCB board.  
The overall system works as the block diagram shows below. The microcontroller is to generate pulse to MOSFET driver to switch the MOSFET in H-Bridge during the operation. Feedback circuit is always watching the load voltage and current and feedback status to microcontroller, if any over-voltage or over-current condition occurs, the microcontroller immediately compensate the pulse proper operating load voltage or current.

Introduction
============
H-Bridge is a DC-DC converter topology which has four switching components in the system, which here are N-Channel MOSFETs, across a transformer. During the operation, a pair of MOSFETs is switched
