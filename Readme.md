H-Bridge DC-DC Converter (In progress)
========================
This repository is a project about DC-DC converter, it is going to step down from high voltage 360V to low voltage 50V for driving load. The circuit will be constructed on a prototype board and later on will be move on to PCB board.

Introduction
============
H-Bridge is a DC-DC converter topology which has four switching components in the system, which here are N-Channel MOSFETs, across a transformer. During the operation, a pair of MOSFETs is switched
