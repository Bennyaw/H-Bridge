H-Bridge DC-DC Converter (In progress)
========================
This repository is a project about **SMPS H-Bridge DC-DC converter**, it is going to step down from high voltage 360V to low voltage 50V for driving load. The circuit will be constructed on a prototype board and later on will be move on to PCB board.  
The overall system works as the block diagram shows below. The microcontroller is to generate pulse to MOSFET driver to switch the MOSFET in H-Bridge during the operation. Feedback circuit is always watching the load voltage and current and feedback status to microcontroller, if any over-voltage or over-current condition occurs, the microcontroller immediately compensate the pulse proper operating load voltage or current.

## <a name = hbridge></a> H-Bridge   
H-Bridge is a DC-DC converter topology which has four switching components in the system, which here are N-Channel MOSFETs, across a transformer. During the operation, a pair of MOSFETs is switched on 1 side of the driver at the same time.  
When "a pair of MOSFETs is switched" means that either 1 MOSFET is turn **OFF** and another 1 is **ON**, from the schmatic below, M1, M2 is a pair and drove by 1 MOSFET Driver, M3,M4 will be another one.
The arrow shows how the current go through the MOSFET during the operation.
In order let current flow, either M1 M4 turn **ON** , or either M2 M3 turn **ON**.

## <a name = ir2113></a> IR2113 MOSFET Driver
The reason we want to have a driver is because there is the Highside MOSFET, which is M1 and M3 from the circuit above, do not have sufficient Vgs value to turn **ON** fully, therefore it cannot deliver full power to the load. So, the driver is used here.  
In the circuit of IR2113 below, the bootstrap capacitor will be charged up to VCC voltage when to highside MOSFET is OFF, source voltage of MOSFET is floating. When the transistor is turn ON, the bootstrap capacitor will make sure the gate-source voltage is enough to fully turn on the transistor. Suggested VCC supply to IR2113 is 15V.
